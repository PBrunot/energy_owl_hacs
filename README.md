This integration allows to connect an Energy OWL CM160 on a homeassistant instant and retrieve the electrical current measurement from it.
You will need to specify the port path (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0 or COM4) during integration configuration.
Allow for a few minutes before the sensor with CM160 current is updated.
